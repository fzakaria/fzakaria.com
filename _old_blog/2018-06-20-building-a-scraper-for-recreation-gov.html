<h3> The start of a new project </h3>
<p>
A friend has recently asked if I can look into building a tool / site to scrape <a href="https://recreation.gov">https://recreation.gov</a> -- with a end-goal of building a system to <em>automatically reserve</em> for a desired permit.</p>
<p>This piqued my interest and lets take a look at what I can do! At a high level I imagined building:<br />
<em>register desired site -> continously scrape -> reserve -> notify via text</em></p>
<p>Looks like a good chance to put together some interesting technologies: web-framework (django?) & <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">twilio</a> to send notifications</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>
Before beginning any project, I take a look at the current space and see if there are any current <em>open source alternatives</em> or even a paid platform to leverage.</p>
<p>I found the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/webrender/campsite-checker">https://github.com/webrender/campsite-checker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bri-bri/yosemite-camping">https://github.com/bri-bri/yosemite-camping</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I could <strong>not find</strong> a paid service and the OSS options seemed very difficult for non technical people to use.</p>
<h4> Can I haz API? </h4>
<p>
Browsing online -- I was ecstatic when I came across <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">ridb.recreation.gov</a> which is a REST API for the recreation.gov website -- unfortunately it doesn't let you perform reservations and I couldn't decipher yet how to link them to the reservation portion. Perhaps it might be leveraged in the future!</p>
<p>Time to use our favorite reverse engineering tools: <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a> & <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a> -- I ended up using Charles specifically because I find it easier to setup as a man-in-the-middle HTTPS proxy.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can follow the simple guide on how to setup Charles as a HTTPS proxy <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/proxying/ssl-proxying/">here</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the raw request from Charles when searching locations matching <em>whitney</em> at <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/unifSearch.do">https://www.recreation.gov/unifSearch.do</a><br />
(unimportant parts stripped out)</p>
<p><code class="oldblog"><br />
POST /unifSearch.do HTTP/1.1<br />

</code></p>
<p>The important part is that it is <em>x-www-form-urlencoded</em> with <em>locationCriteria=whitney</em>.</p>
<p>The response is HTML however we can use various tools to strip out the desired list.</p>
