  <p>This is <em>part 2</em> of a post regarding VPNs. Please see <a href="/2020/09/20/vpns-from-first-principles.html">here</a> for part 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the <a href="/2020/09/20/vpns-from-first-principles.html">previous post</a>, we discussed the basics of setting up a virtual private network; the goal of which was bridging two distinct private subnets.</p>

<p>This gave us the alluring property of treating separate networks as they were colocated and can be accessed easily. However most people are first introduced into VPNs for other features such as: <em>anonymity</em>, <em>secrecy</em> &amp; <em>privacy</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A common example may be to tunnel traffic through a host in another country to disguise the origin. For instance, maybe you are in Canada but want to browse the American Netflix catalog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>How can we extend <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/lametun">lametun</a> to do this?</em></p>

<p>I’ll present a few alternatives. The main goal however will to forward all traffic, including ones destined for the Internet, through the tunnel.</p>

<!--more-->
<h3 id="common-setup">Common Setup</h3>

<p>In both alternatives, we will want to make some adjustments to our server. We will want to <strong>enable</strong> <em>ip_forward</em> &amp; <strong>disable</strong> <em>rp_filter</em>. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> We also want to create an <em>iptable</em> rule to setup a NAT.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><em>ip_forward</em></dt>
  <dd>IP forwarding is the ability for an operating system to accept incoming network packets on one interface, recognize that it is not meant for the system itself, but that it should be passed on to another network, and then forwards it accordingly.</dd>
  <dt><em>rp_filter</em></dt>
  <dd>Reverse Path filtering is a mechanism to check whether a receiving packet source address is routable. The machine will first check whether the source of the received packet is reachable through the interface it came in. If it is not routable, it will *drop the packet.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sysctl <span class="nt">-w</span> <span class="s2">"net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0"</span>
sysctl <span class="nt">-w</span> <span class="s2">"net.ipv4.ip_forward=1"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now on <strong>the server</strong>, we will introduce an <em>iptable</em> rule to forward all incoming packets from our <em>tun0</em> device to <em>eth0</em>, or whatever our physical device is.
Furthermore, we will set the target to <em>MASQUERADE</em>.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><em>MASQUERADE</em></dt>
  <dd>Masks requests from LAN nodes with the IP address of the physical device; it is used in conjunction with NAT.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># The -j MASQUERADE target is specified to mask the private IP address of a node</span>
<span class="c"># with the external IP address of the firewall/gateway</span>
<span class="c"># POSTROUTING allows packets to be altered as they are leaving the device</span>
<span class="c"># The -t nat creates the rule on the NAT table for address translation</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>iptables <span class="nt">-t</span> nat <span class="nt">-A</span> POSTROUTING <span class="nt">-o</span> eth0 <span class="nt">-s</span> 172.31.255.7 <span class="nt">-j</span> MASQUERADE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>The reason why the NAT is necessary?</em></p>

<p>Well if the packets destined for the Internet were sent off with the <em>source IP</em> of our new private CIDR (i.e. 172.31.255.7 for tun0), how would they ever route back to the machine?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not clear yet to me whether you can fake or respond to ARP requests to have the other private IP route back. I’d love to hear <a href="mailto:farid.m.zakaria@gmail.com">from you</a> if you think it can!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="approach-1-routing-rules">Approach #1: routing rules</h3>

<p>Now that our server is setup to forward all traffic to <em>eth0</em> using the <em>iptable rule</em>, our remaining action is to make sure our public traffic flows through our <em>tun0</em> device.</p>

<p>We will use Linux’s support for multiple routing tables,<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to accomplish this goal. We will create a new routing table <em>lametun</em>, which is referred to when the <em>source IP</em> of the packet is that of our <em>tun0</em> device.</p>

<p>The route table <em>lametun</em>, only needs a <strong>single</strong> entry. Route everything through the <em>tun0</em> device!</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Add the rule if the src address is our tun0 addr then</span>
<span class="c"># lookup the lametun routing table</span>
❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip rule add from 172.31.255.7 lookup lametun

❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip rule show table lametun
5209:   from 172.31.255.7 lookup lametun

<span class="c"># Add the single route to send all traffic to our "gateway" (the tunnel)</span>
❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip route add default via 172.31.255.7 dev tun0 table lametun

❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip route show table lametun
default via 172.31.255.7 dev tun0

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s try to use <em>ping</em> but have it select the <em>source IP</em> to that of our <em>tun0</em> device; let’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ping 8.8.8.8</code>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>❯ ping <span class="nt">-I</span> tun0 8.8.8.8

<p>Sweet! <em>Validated</em>.</p>

<p>We even can see the IP being <em>masqueraded</em> from <em>172.31.255.7</em> -&gt; <em>172.31.9.116</em> as it leaves the server.</p>

<p>Since my server is in AWS, ultimately the <em>public IP</em> seen by the Internet will be that attached to my server. With this setup, we now can conceal our source physical location by having a server masquerade as us :)</p>

<h3 id="approach-2-network-namespace">Approach #2: network namespace</h3>

<p>Routing tables work great, however they rely on the ability to tell the desired process what <em>source IP</em> to use when opening the socket; that is not always plausible.</p>

<p>Consider an application like Chrome or Firefox, it does not expose a method in which to control which <em>source IP</em> it uses.</p>

<p>For such cases, we will rely on a more thorough setup using <em>network namespaces</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack,
with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First let’s setup the network namespace using a <em>virtual ethernet device</em> that we will use to bridge the network namespace &amp; the host namespace.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Create a new network namespace</span>
❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip netns add lametun

<span class="c"># Create a virtual ethernet device which will help move traffic</span>
<span class="c"># from the netns to the host namespace</span>
<span class="c"># Consider this like a wire connecting our network namespcae &amp;</span>

❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip <span class="nb">link </span>add veth0 <span class="nb">type </span>veth peer name veth1

<span class="c"># Let's give it it's own subnet for simplicity</span>
❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip addr add 10.0.0.7/24 dev veth0

<span class="c"># Move the veth1 to the lametun network namespace</span>
❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip <span class="nb">link set </span>veth1 netns lametun
<span class="c"># Make sure to give it in an address in the same subnet</span>
<span class="c"># and set all the devices up!</span>

❯ <span class="nb">sudo </span>ip netns <span class="nb">exec </span>lametun ip <span class="nb">link set </span>up dev veth1

<span class="c"># Let's verify we can ping our virtual ethernet devices!</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s add Internet access!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there is a simpler approach using bridges, macvlan or ipvlan <a href="mailto:farid.m.zakaria@gmail.com">let me know</a>. I didn’t want to move the IP address from my main ethernet device to the bridge, so this approach seemed easy enough but it needs <em>iptables</em>.</p>

<p>Great! We have Internet traffic but it’s just going through the typical flow.</p>

<p>We can now start <strong>lametun</strong> inside this network namespace and all <em>default traffic</em> will go through our VPN!</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Create the TUN device in the namespace &amp; set it up</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The final <em>cherry on top</em>, is to make sure DNS works inside the namespace.
For that let’s create a file <strong>/etc/netns/lametun/resolv.conf</strong> with the following contents:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>❯ <span class="nb">cat</span> /etc/netns/lametun/resolv.conf

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We now have a <em>really lame</em> VPN that you can use to try and add some level of indirection to your requests. Just make sure to star the desired process within the network namespace.</p>
