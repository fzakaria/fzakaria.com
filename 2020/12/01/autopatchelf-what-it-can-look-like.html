<p>I finished with a bit of a <em>teaser</em> on what a full-fledged tool may look like‚Ä¶</p>

<h3 id="autopatchelf">autopatchelf</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/autopatchelf">autopatchelf</a> is my <em>work in progress</em> in what the other half of on-demand linked libraries may look &amp; feel like.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don‚Äôt judge me on the code, it‚Äôs still in exploratory phase. üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs goal is quite simple and works in tandem with <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a>. <em>autopatchelf</em> attempts to locate a valid <em>/nix/store</em> entry for every required library required by the binary.</p>

<p>An <em>asciinema</em> is worth a thousand words.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a small example of how running <em>autopatchelf</em> will prompt the user to select the most appropriate matching library for the Ruby binary. It‚Äôs pretty quick..</p>
</blockquote>

<script id="asciicast-376182" src="https://asciinema.org/a/376182.js" async="" data-speed="0.5"></script>

<p>Once the libraries are chosen, it‚Äôs <em>mostly</em> a straightforward invocation to <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a> with the set <em>NIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> environment variable.</p>

<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>

<p>I already foresee a few challenges (all solvable!) that need to be addressed for a thorough solution which I want to articulate here for others that might want to pursue this idea.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A garbage-collection root must be created for all realised <em>/nix/store</em> entries. This is to avoid the chosen libraries from being garbage-collected during process run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/autopatchelf">autopatchelf</a> will try to normalize or find closest matching libraries if a non-exact match can be found. The ELF binary itself then must be patched to set the selected names.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solving for diamond dependencies must be performed. For instance, the selected glibc version must match the same one used in all the selected <em>/nix/store</em> paths. It may be necessary to build a depth-first graph of selected libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A cache file ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù of the selected libraries can be saved for the binary so that subsequent startups are faster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An option to directly edit the ELF binary rather than supply the <em>NIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> variable should be possible.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The long-term vision is anyone can either start any non-NixOS binary if this functionality is directly embedded within the <em>ld</em> interpreter, patch the ELF binary interactively for the required libraries or even ship the ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù file alongside the binary for others to consume.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a lot of promise in the idea especially for unlocking cases where users may lean on <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-fhs-environments">buildFHSUserEnv</a>.</p>
