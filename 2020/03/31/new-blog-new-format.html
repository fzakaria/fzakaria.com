      <p>Hello World.</p>

<p>I’ve moved my blog from “Small Thoughts” <a href="http://blog.fzakaria.com">blog.fzakaria.com</a>, which was hosted on Wordpress &amp; S3, one using Jekyll via Github Pages.</p>

<p>Why Github Pages and not S3 still? I wanted to see what all the fuss was about &amp; it sounded simpler to set up the TLS certificates.</p>

<p>You may notice that the theme of this blog is <strong>very</strong> similar to that
of <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew Devault’s</a>; in fact, it is based on his published theme.</p>

<p>I admired on his blog his <a href="https://drewdevault.com/make-a-blog">campaign</a> to get others blogging that I revived my forgotten blog. I enjoyed the minimalism of his blog and embraced it. The site uses very minimal <em>fancy</em> Jekyll plugins, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/fzakaria.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’m still a novice to Jekyll &amp; blogging in general; feel empowered to reach out to teach me or discuss.</p>
