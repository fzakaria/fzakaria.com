    <p>Despite having used Nix for several years already, I feel secure in admitting that new concepts in Nix continue to be confusing at first glance.</p>

<p>I had avoided doing any <em>secret management</em> for Nix for a long time, largely because I ran Nix atop another Linux distribution, but now that I‚Äôm on NixOS <em>my time hath come</em>.</p>

<p>I wanted to write out my learnings here so that others may benefit from the <em>ELI5</em> style of learning that we are missing in Nix.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve given <em>a lot</em> of Nix talks. I‚Äôve given Nix talks internally at companies where I‚Äôve introduced it, at local meetups and even at NixCon.</p>

<p>Giving a talk about Nix is hard. As engineers I find often we try to explain <strong>why</strong> or <strong>how</strong> Nix works but never show the end result.</p>

<p>Many of the talks I‚Äôve given start explaining <em>‚ÄúNix developed as part of Eelco‚Äôs PhD thesis in 2003‚Äù</em> and immediately eyes roll.</p>

    <p>Reproducibility has become a <em>big</em> deal. Whether it‚Äôs having higher confidence in one‚Äôs build or trying to better understand your supply chain for provenance, having an accurate view of your build graph is a <em>must</em>.</p>

<p>Tools such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> have picked up mainstream usage from their advocacy by large companies that use it or via similar derivatives such as Buck. These companies write &amp; proclaim how internally it‚Äôs solved many of their software development lifecycle problems. They‚Äôve graciously open-sourced these tools for us to use so that we may also reap similar benefits. <em>Sounds great right?</em></p>

      </span>
    </h2>
    
    <p>Since the introduction of Nix and similar store-based systems such as <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> or <a href="https://spack.io/">Spack</a>, I have been fascinated about finding improvements that take advantage of the new paradigms they introduce. Linux distributions are traditionally dynamic in nature, with shared libraries and executables being linked at runtime. Store-based systems, however, are static in nature, with all dependencies being resolved at build time. This determinism allows for not only reproducibility but also the ability to optimize various aspects of our toolchain.</p>

<p>Work that I‚Äôve have <a href="/2022/03/14/shrinkwrap-taming-dynamic-shared-objects.html">written previously</a> about shows that there are worthwhile speedups that can be gained. While previously, I focused on improving the <em>stat storm</em> that occurs when resolving dependencies, I have recently been looking at speeding up the ELF relocations that occur when executing a program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can check out my publication <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05118">Mapping Out the HPC Dependency Chaos</a> about the development of <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/shrinkwrap">shrinkwrap</a> if you are interested in the topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Extending the idea further, I have been looking at how we can optimize the ELF relocations that occur when executing a program. In this post, I will discuss the basics of ELF relocations and symbol resolution and how we can optimize these processes for store-based systems.</p>

    <p>GitHub Actions have now become an integral part of many open source projects, providing a free &amp; powerful CI system. I am surprised however there is no provided way to visualize the run length time (or other meaningful metrics) of your actions.</p>

  <p>üïµÔ∏è I did find a few other third-party solutions that either extract the data or themselves can be added <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/workflow-telemetry">as a step</a> to your workflow to get similar visualizations. I wanted something <em>simpler</em>.</p>

<p>I previously wrote a post about <a href="/2024/02/27/hermetic-but-at-what-cost.html">the cost of runfiles</a> which had become evident when we noticed our GitHub Bazel build workflow had slowed down by 50x.</p>

I had the hunch that the existing tooling we have to interface with our object formats, such as ELF, are antiquated and ill specified.</p>

<p>Declarative languages, such as SQL, are such a wonderful abstraction to articulate over data layouts and let you reason about <em>what you want</em> rather than <em>how to get it</em>.</p>

<p>Since continuing to noodle üë®‚Äçüíª on the project, I‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised at some of the introspection, specifically with respect to symbols, I‚Äôve been able
to accomplish with SQL that would have been a pain using traditional tools.</p>
