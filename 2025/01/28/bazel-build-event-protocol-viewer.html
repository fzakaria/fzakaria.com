<p>I consider myself a ‚Äúbackend‚Äù engineer.</p>

<p>Although I have dabbled in UI frameworks professionally (.NET and the occasional JavaScript) ‚Äì I rarely work on the front-end visual portion of a product.</p>

<p>My knowledge of HTML/CSS has been forever cemented since I learnt the technology in my teens ‚Äì culminating in the ultimate personal expression of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;marquee&gt;</code> on GeoCities.</p>

<p>Revisiting front-end development for occasional projects has always been stress-inducing. The pace of change in the ecosystem is fast from the toolset to even the language (üëã TypeScript).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Nevertheless, this last weekend I was lazer focused on a single goal.</p>

<p><em>To build a front-end only website to visualize the <a href="https://bazel.build/remote/bep">Build Event Protocol (BEP)</a> for Bazel</em> üéØ.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Build Event Protocol (BEP) is a protocol buffer message format that describes various events during a Bazel invocation that can help provide insights or provide a beautiful UI to display build results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>I‚Äôm in awe &amp; admiration of all the tooling others have built in the Bazel ecosystem to do something similar however they all necessitate a server.</p>

<p>Although running a server isn‚Äôt an incredibly tall-order, it‚Äôs still a step that must be taken. Providing a free &amp; open server solution is also possible ‚Äì but then I would have to worry about scale and costs.</p>

<p>A <em>client-only</em> solution although limited by what it might be able to display, felt like a great contribution to the ecosystem. A nice addition is that client-only solutions also put at ease security minded individuals when uploading potentially sensitive data.</p>

<p>As someone without much frontend experience, I‚Äôm happy with the results. üòä</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/build_event_protocol_viewer_overview.png" alt="Build Event Protocol Viewer Overview" /></p>

<p>This project is available on <a href="https://visible.build">visible.build</a>, available at <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/build-event-protocol-viewer">https://github.com/fzakaria/build-event-protocol-viewer</a>, hosted on GitHub Pages and should be ready to explore your Bazel invocations ü§ò.</p>

<p>The project is built as a single-page-application (SPA) and pre-rendered so there is absolutely no server requests beyond fetching the static-content.</p>

<p>I chose to use <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> to generate the UI ‚Äì oddly seemed to <em>fit my brain</em>. It‚Äôs as if <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> &amp; <a href="https://angular.dev/">Angular</a> had a baby. Coupled with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> I was able to get a semi-decent looking CSS without much fanfare.</p>

<p>I leveraged &amp; learnt TypeScript, which coupled with <a href="https://github.com/protobufjs">protobufjs</a> to build the equivalent classes for the protocol definitions, made it relatively straightforward to explore the model. The main challenge was the abundance of fields, many of which were marked as <em>deprecated</em> in the proto definition file.</p>

<p>A nice cherry ontop üçí this project is that it has a <em>clear end state</em> that it achieved; which is rare in projects. I set out to do a <em>single thing</em> (i.e. make a simple client-side only UI for BEP), and there‚Äôs only so much you can do without a server.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve reached that end state. Visualized <em>nearly</em> at most what I could from the single protocol file and achieved <em>project nirvana</em>. üßòüèº</p>

<p><em>Give it a shot. Contribute if you see a bug. Please let me know if you are using it.</em></p>
