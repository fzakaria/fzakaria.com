<h2 id="why-sorbet">Why Sorbet?</h2>

<p>This was a surprisingly challenging argument to make to those only accustomed to working with Ruby. Those in the <em>thick</em> of the codebase felt unencumbered by the lack of types and imagined it would only hinder their development.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve come to appreciate that Ruby follows a simple axiom in which <strong>it favors the writer not the reader</strong>. Itâ€™s what makes Ruby such a pleasure to write however a pain to read.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the tide has been turning for most languages. Python 3 has optional types, Typescript was introduced and types have been formally released in <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rbs">Ruby 3</a>.</p>

<p>Sorbet, aware of these hesitations, was designed with them in mind. It offers: gradual typing, runtime validation, static validation and is extremely fast on large codebases.</p>

<h2 id="jruby-integration">JRuby Integration</h2>

<p>Sorbet was not designed to work with JRuby in mind initially, however I found that not much was needed to get it working.</p>

<h2 id="sorbet-static">sorbet-static</h2>

<p>The primary blocker, which Iâ€™ve upstreamed was the creation of a Java platform gem for <em>sorbet-static</em>. This means you can easily add it to any existing JRuby Gemfile and have the static binary available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are curious, checkout <a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/commit/3c508a9c948a3b456cf564a5fb01279da1ffdc44">3c508a9c948a3b456cf564a5fb01279da1ffdc44</a>. We package the Darwin and Linux compiled binary within the gem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ruby-interface-files">Ruby Interface Files</h3>

<p>Sorbet performs gradual typing and can easily be incorporated into large codebase, since it can auto-generate Ruby Interface (RBI) files for gems you include.</p>

<p>I found however that if your JRuby codebase calls out to Java-native code, the interpreter often-times fails to generate the RBI files.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The technical reason is because the Java code is never officially required so that it never ends up being triggered through TracePoint</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A pattern that worked well, was a hand-curated pattern for the creation of RBI files for the Java libraries the codebase uses.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tree ./sorbet
|------ config
|------ rbi
    |-------- java
    |   |---------- java_lang.rbi # this is the standard library
    |   |---------- org_eclipse_jgit.rbi
    |   |---------- org_apache_logging_log4j.rbi
    |-------------  org_slf4j.rbi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The naming convention is simple, it is the maven coordinates for a given Java package (replaced with underscores).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ðŸ’¡ There is an opportunity to include java_lang into <a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet-typed">sorbet-typed</a> at the very least.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The RBI files can be as strongly typed as you desire.</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># typed: strong</span>
<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Java</span>
  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">OrgEclipseJgitApiErrors</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">JGitInternalException</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Exception</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="naming-convention">Naming Convention</h3>

<p>Furthermore, there are a variety of ways in which to <a href="https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/CallingJavaFromJRuby">call out to Java code</a> from JRuby, but not all of them work for matching to the RBI files.</p>

<p>Consider these two approaches, which are <em>valid calling conventions</em> into Java.</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Option 1</span>
<span class="n">org</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">department</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Widget</span>

<span class="c1"># Option 2</span>
<span class="no">Java</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">OrgFooDepartment</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Widget</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our codebase unfortunately <strong>heavily</strong> favored the former, which to Sorbet resembles method calls as opposed to the latter being module namespacing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ðŸ’¡ There is an opportunity to fixup the code automatically via a Rubocop rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="disabling-runtime-verification">Disabling Runtime Verification</h3>

<p>This has perhaps been the most upsetting thing, the runtime verification was disabled in the codebase. I had discovered (<a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/issues/2316">#2316</a>) there are some concurrency-bugs with it since the Sorbet team primarily works with CRuby which still has a global lock (GIL).</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve had to resort to the following in our codebase.</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># The Sorbet team develops strictly on MRI</span>
<span class="c1"># Discovered issue https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/issues/2316</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># To circumvent this, at the moment the `sorbet-runtime`</span>
<span class="c1"># is effectively changed to be T::Sig::WithoutRuntime</span>
<span class="c1"># https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/blob/master/gems/sorbet/lib/t.rb</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># We still leverage the static checker (srb tc) &amp;</span>
<span class="c1"># using sig's as a form of documentation.</span>
<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">T::Sig</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sig</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">blk</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I am hoping with more attention and use by others in JRuby, this issue can be solved.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Even without <em>runtime validation</em>, the <strong>sig</strong>â€™s use as a form of documentation far surpasses that of <a href="https://yardoc.org/">YARDOC</a> and the <em>static checking</em> continues to be helpful.</p>

<p>Without the ability to auto-generate RBI files for the code-base and the incorrect calling convention, we were not able to run <strong>srb init</strong> over the whole codebase.</p>

<p>Instead, weâ€™ve taken a tactical approach of refactoring modules into their own gem and at that time raising the requirement that all new gems require Sorbet typing.</p>

<p>Adoption has definitely slowed, since the cost of refactoring code into a distinct gem is as high as rewriting it natively in Java/Kotlin.</p>

<p>I look forward to Ruby 3 and wider adoption of typing in the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ðŸ˜ž I am dismayed that Ruby 3 did not chose to allow inline type signatures.</p>
