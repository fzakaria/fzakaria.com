My blog has been a little quiet. I recently accepted a new role at [Meta](https://meta.com/) and it's been keeping me busy!

_Once the onboarding phase is done I hope to get back to my Nix contributions._

Accepting the position at Meta has had me reflecting on my journey to this current role. People often share their highlights of accepting a new role but rarely their _lowlights_.

I wanted to share a brief look at what interviewing might be like in the software industry. People are often discouraged by failure but it's part of the process.

I remember having done interview training at Google where they discussed most interviewers decide on the outcome of the interview within the first-five minutes. That story is not to totally discourage the oneself from the process but rather to demonstrate there is a portion out of your control.

Going through my emails to get an accurate accounting is challenging however I found threads as early as 2011 interviewing for Facebook. I am actually sure I had interviewed ealier through my co-ops at University of Waterloo, but I don't have access anylonger to those emails.

Some _rough_ dates I had found: 2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023*, 2024, 2025.

\* This interview round was long and was for 3 distinct roles.

Across those years, the interview level was different and sometimes the role (IC vs EM).

Don't be discouraged from failure.
