What is interesting about deleted posts are that I still received a Facebook notification in the top left corner stating that she had posted something however clicking the item does nothing. If you&#39;ve signed up for Facebook e-mail notifications however, you can track the notification down via the e-mail sent and it should contain a short summary of the post; allowing me to see the deleted content (which seems kind of odd). The whole process of deleting Facebook posts really seemed odd and as a result I wrote a quick web page in order to try and play around with the functionality of deleting messages. You can find the web page here: http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/code/spammer/. It should be self explanatory enough to use. Things didn&#39;t work out as planned. I had originally thought that I could write a Facebook Spammer that would immediately clean up and delete all the messages posted on someone&#39;s wall with the intention of the receiver having a very large fake number in their notification tray.

With this option no longer possible, I&#39;m sitting back and thinking what I can do with the following possibilities: I can spam multiple messages on a friend&#39;s wall. I can delete the messages immediately written on a friend&#39;s wall. I can give a single fake notification to a friend. I can potentially send secret messages to friends via the e-mail notification system. The last item on the list seems to intrigue me the most however I can&#39;t seem to think of a neat idea for it. I have the ability to tell someone I&#39;ve sent them a secret message via Facebook that they can read via an e-mail notification, however I&#39;m not sure how that can be any more useful than sending an actual e-mail. I&#39;m going to sit on this for a bit and ponder, however in the mean time you can use the web page to spam some friend&#39;s walls if you&#39;d like. DISCLAIMER: I&#39;m not responsible if Facebook monitors spamming activity and they take any action.

<h2> Things didn't work out as planned. </h2>
<p>
I had originally thought that I could write a Facebook Spammer that would immediately clean up and delete all the messages posted on someone's wall with the intention of the receiver having a <em>very large fake number</em> in their notification tray. This however did not turn out to be the case, as Facebook collects all recent activity per person and groups it under a <strong>single </strong>notification. With this option no longer possible, I'm sitting back and thinking what I can do with the following possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can spam multiple messages on a friend's wall.</li>
<li>I can delete the messages immediately written on a friend's wall.</li>
<li>I can give a <strong>single</strong> fake notification to a friend.</li>
<li>I can potentially send <em>secret</em> messages to friends via the e-mail notification system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last item on the list seems to intrigue me the most however I can't seem to think of a neat idea for it. I have the ability to tell someone I've sent them a secret message via Facebook that they can read via an e-mail notification, however I'm not sure how that can be any more useful than sending <em>an actual e-mail</em>. I'm going to sit on this for a bit and ponder, however in the mean time you can use the <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/code/spammer/">web page</a> to spam some friend's walls if you'd like.</p>
