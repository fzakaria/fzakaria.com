      <h2>Wah Happened?!</h2>
<p>
During the last week I got a lot of e-mails from people telling me how the extension was no longer working for them. The complaint was the name of the song downloaded seemed to have been 'garbled' or no longer working. I'm sorry it took me a while (~1 week) to dig into it, however I now have published the fix into a new branch on Github.</p>
<pre class="bash">
#Run this from 'Terminal' on your mac for instance
git clone -b chrome-bug-373182 git@github.com:fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension.git
</pre></p>
<p> For those curious, the regression (bug) looks to be caused by Chrome/Chromium and is currently being tracked <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=373182">here</a>, where they don't seem to be respecting the download attribute for anchor tags.</p>
<p>Enjoy the music,<br />
Farid</p>
