      <h2> I'm so slow </h2>
<p>
I'm been so caught up in my new website project (downloading songs from HypeMachine as well), that I've really left the extension and python script fall behind.<br />
In an attempt to try and rectify this, I've made the first step by fixing/updating the python script. I've already documented many of the changes that needed to occur in my <a href="http://blog.fzakaria.com/2012/10/hypem-api-changes/">previous</a> blog post but now here is the full source for those who are curious!</p>
<blockquote><p>You can download the script here: <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScript">https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScript</a></p></blockquote>
<p>
I've substantially cleaned up the code and removed the sqlite (database) aspect to it. This has resulted in a nice clean barebone downloader which does the one job it needs to do; <em>download'em songs!</em>. I'm always looking for advice, comments and feedback.</p>
