<meta name="description" content="Reverse Engineering I lately had a special event where a photographer took some photos of the occasion and used PhotoReflect to host/sell me them. The price per photo is 29$ or the whole set (90) 699$. I consider that an egregious amount to charge, considering that her services were supposedly already included with the event. The following are some instructions you can follow for downloading the non-water marked medium quality images. This assumes that you are running on a Mac however the commands can easily be modified for any setup. #Install a helpful tool to make HTTP requests - similar to cURL but nicer brew install http #Grab a single image id from the URL (click on any photo) and find the part with &quot;pi=03PD17RD000000&quot;. #That ID represents the ID for that photo. #Suppose the store they send you to is http://myfakestore.photoreflect.com/store/ #Execute the following: http &quot;http://myfakestore.photoreflect.com/web/bin/prpv.dll?cmd=photo&amp;s=-3&amp;i=03PD17RD000000&amp;p=1&quot; &quot;Referer:http://myfakestore.photoreflect.com/store/thumbpage.aspx?e=9729609&quot; &gt; 03PD17RD000000.jpeg The real magic here is in the s=-3 portion of the request, which I&#39;ve found returns the image without the water-mark. I still haven&#39;t figured out how to download the HighQuality images, but if you find out please share!

      <h2>Reverse Engineering</h2>
<p>I lately had a special event where a photographer took some photos of the occasion and used <a href="http://www.photoreflect.com/mktx/index.html">PhotoReflect</a> to host/sell me them.</p>
<p>The price <strong>per photo</strong> is 29$ or the whole set (90) 699$. I consider that an egregious amount to charge, considering that her services were supposedly already included with the event.</p>
<p>
The following are some instructions you can follow for downloading the non-water marked <strong>medium quality</strong> images. This assumes that you are running on a Mac however the commands can easily be modified for any setup.</p>
<pre class="wrap:true lang:bash decode:true " title="Reverse Engineering PhotoReflect" >
#Install a helpful tool to make HTTP requests - similar to cURL but nicer
brew install http
#Grab a single image id from the URL (click on any photo) and find the part with "pi=03PD17RD000000".
#That ID represents the ID for that photo.
#Suppose the store they send you to is http://myfakestore.photoreflect.com/store/
#Execute the following:
http "http://myfakestore.photoreflect.com/web/bin/prpv.dll?cmd=photo&s=-3&i=03PD17RD000000&p=1" "Referer:http://myfakestore.photoreflect.com/store/thumbpage.aspx?e=9729609" > 03PD17RD000000.jpeg
</pre>
<p>The real magic here is in the <code>s=-3</code> portion of the request, which I've found returns the image without the water-mark.</p>
