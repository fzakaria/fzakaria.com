<meta name="description" content="Unity 3 Unity 3 is a game development engine. It helps abstract a lot of the repetitive grunt work of game design by abstracting it into a reusable engine. Is it Unity 3 or Unity 3D? I don&#39;t really care because I&#39;m loving it. Using a fully fledged and amazing game engine seemed to have been the logical choice. At first I started with building my own simple 2D Game engine, moving forward to the XNA framework (one extra level of abstraction), to finally using a complete game engine. I have had previous experience with a few different types of game engines through my co-op experience within the video games industry, and Unity is one my most enjoyable experiences. I followed the excellent video tutorials found here by 3D Buzz. The tutorials cover creating the classic 2D Space Shooter. Following the video, I&#39;m creating a simple 3D Pong game and although it is very basic it actually exposes you to a lot of the features of the engine. You can test it out here (Click to Start): [WP_UnityObject altimage=&quot;&quot;/code/Unity/Pong.png&quot; src=&quot;/code/Unity/FirstGame.unity3d&quot;/] Reasons why I loved it Personal preference is what divides me from you, and our preference for game engines will likely differ. Personally I enjoy the &#39;1 complete application&#39; game engine, that bundles all systems of the engine into a single application (i.e. animation editor, map editor, playing the game) as opposed to a collection of tools that when combined together become a game engine. Each type has their own pros &amp; cons however through my co-op experiences at Digital Extremes (single game engine application) and Capcom Vancouver (uses a collection of tools) I got to experience both and even then I had preferred the single application architecture. To be honest, Unity 3 is very similar in functionality, architecture and feel to the proprietary game engine developed by Digital Extremes I haven&#39;t yet gone head first into Unity (although I&#39;d say I have both feet wet), I&#39;m amazed at how well they have incorporated data driven design and the component based architecture into the engine. You hear/read a lot of explanations of both design paradigms and see how many people misunderstand it and possibly butcher it. Unity decouples everything beatifully and presents it to you in a very elegant manner. You truly cannot understand/comprehend the power of data driven and component based design until you&#39;re working with an engine that does it right. Exposing variables via scripts (C# or Javascript) that can be changed dynamically through the engine, lets you analyze and test games in ways that makes all others seem obsolete.

      <h2> Unity 3 </h2>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/">Unity 3</a> is a game development engine. It helps abstract a lot of the repetitive grunt work of game design by abstracting it into a reusable engine.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Is it Unity 3 or Unity 3D? I don't really care because I'm loving it. Using a fully fledged and amazing game engine seemed to have been the logical choice. At first I started with building my own <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/2011/08/game-engine-finally-getting-around-to-it/">simple 2D Game engine</a>, moving forward to the <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/2011/09/first-thoughts-on-xna-4-0-game-architecture/">XNA framework</a> (one extra level of abstraction), to finally using a complete game engine. I have had previous experience with a few different types of game engines through my co-op experience within the video games industry, and Unity is one my most enjoyable experiences.</p>
<p>
I followed the excellent video tutorials found <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/37093-Over-7-hours-of-Unity-Training-Videos-Download-them-now!">here</a> by 3D Buzz. The tutorials cover creating the classic 2D Space Shooter. Following the video, I'm creating a simple 3D Pong game and although it is very basic it actually exposes you to a lot of the features of the engine.</p>

<h2> Reasons why I loved it</h2>
<p>
Personal preference is what divides me from you, and our preference for game engines will likely differ. Personally I enjoy the '<em>1 complete application</em>' game engine, that bundles all systems of the engine into a single application (i.e. animation editor, map editor, playing the game) as opposed to a collection of tools that when combined together become a game engine. Each type has their own pros & cons however through my co-op experiences at <a href="http://www.digitalextremes.com/">Digital Extremes</a> (single game engine application) and <a href="http://capcomvancouver.com/">Capcom Vancouver</a> (uses a collection of tools) I got to experience both and even then I had preferred the single application architecture.</p>
<blockquote><p>To be honest, Unity 3 is very similar in functionality, architecture and feel to the proprietary game engine developed by Digital Extremes</p></blockquote>
<p>
I haven't yet gone head first into Unity (although I'd say I have both feet wet), I'm amazed at how well they have incorporated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming">data driven design</a> and the <a href="http://books.google.at/books?id=G1jQpyZI2JgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false">component based</a> architecture into the engine. You hear/read a lot of explanations of both design paradigms and see how many people misunderstand it and possibly butcher it. Unity decouples everything beatifully and presents it to you in a very elegant manner.</p>
<p>
You truly cannot understand/comprehend the power of data driven and component based design until you're working with an engine that does it <strong>right</strong>. Exposing variables via scripts (C# or Javascript) that can be changed dynamically through the engine, lets you analyze and test games in ways that makes all others seem obsolete.</p>
