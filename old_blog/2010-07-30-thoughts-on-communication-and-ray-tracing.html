<p> I guess to start, I just want to showcase/discuss my final <a href="http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/">CS488</a> project, which was an extended Ray Tracer. I greatly enjoyed writing a ray tracer, because it was truly one of the most modular/distributed programming projects I've done. It seemed to echo nicely much of the software architectural designs I've read about but never truly seen in practice. I could almost imagine it done through <a href="http://www.dossier-andreas.net/software_architecture/pipe_and_filter.html">Pipe-and-filter</a> for instance. </p>
<p>On my upcomming work term, I really look forward to porting the ray tracer into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a> even if I just manage a bare ray tracer it would be pretty cool. </p>
<p>One of the mos difficult aspects of the ray tracer, was surprisingly for me <em>Refraction</em>. What was aggravating was that to have a realistic refraction it required a lot of additional work then some of the other objectives (such as Depth of Field). Needing to implement attenuation (using Beer's law etc..). </p>

<h3> All things manly </h3>
<p>I've been <em>thinking</em> a lot lately (odd I know) about some things about relationships and just between the whole courting process. I think I'm going to write about what I've been thinking about because I've been recently sharing them to some friends and they've found the information pretty useful and informative.</p>

<p>We've all heard how the eyes are the window to the soul, however I've been recently hanging out with some friends who are <del datetime="2010-07-30T19:34:47+00:00">magicians</del> very skilled with people of the opposite sex, and one of the main things I've noticed they do is <strong>truly lock eyes</strong>. </p>
