      <h2>Minor improvements</h2>
<p>
Hasn't been a while since I've written a blog post and this one will be pretty short. I've recently submitted a small push to my <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">HypeMachine-Extension</a>. The commit includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>General code cleanlyness (so people can learn/understand better what it's doing)</li>
<li>Added Google Analytics to see how many songs are being downloaded in general.</li>
<li>Added download attribute so that the song automatically downloads when you click the button!</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the best reason to grab the latest changes is for the download on click fix, which also sets the name of the file download to the "title - artist.mp3"</p>
<h2> Open Questions </h2>
<h3> Ideas for Metrics? </h3>
<p>
I'd love to hear ideas on some neat Google Analytics people would like to see tracked. I'll be publishing the metrics I'm tracking now once I get enough data!</p>
<h3> Google Chrome Store ? </h3>
<p>
Does anyone know enough of copyright law/trademark infringement to help me understand whether I can safely re-publish the extension to the Google Chrome Store?</p>
