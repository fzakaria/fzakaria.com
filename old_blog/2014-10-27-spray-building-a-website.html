      <h2>Spray what?</h2>
<p>
So for my current ongoing project we've been using the excellent <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play! Framework</a>; which although primarily designed for websites we used it for an API WebService. So I figure I'd do the opposite with <a href="http://spray.io">Spray</a>. Spray is a http framework for building web services on top of Akka actors. The next few posts will probably be around some patterns I did in getting a MVP Login demo that accepts UserPassword or OAuth[2] providers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The following is the specific <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/addressme/commit/7eb054bfb96d4dac3c62fea51a82a8a0932c0051">commit</a> which I believe I've achieved enough of an MVP if you'd like to later browse how its done.</p></blockquote>
<h2> Composing Routes </h2>
<p>
All the examples on the Spray website show the DSL for the Routes in a single class however I found this to be confusing and exploded to be too large. There are two options people have discussed when composing routes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create multiple HttpService actors. Have the main actor forward the RequestContext to other actors based on some route prefix</li>
<li>Use a trait to easily compose the routes that will be given to the runRoute method of the single HttpActor</li>
</ol>
<p>Although option (2) sounds less `everything on Akka` ideal, it was the option I chose as I found it very easy to bootstrap and the results were fantastic.</p>
<pre class="lang:scala decode:true " >

  def route: Route
}

object StaticRouter extends Routable {
  override def route: Route = {
    pathPrefix("static") {
      path(RestPath) { path =>
        getFromResource(s"public/$path")
      }
