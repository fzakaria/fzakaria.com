I haven&#39;t managed to grep the logs yet to see some interesting statistics, however we&#39;ve recently passed the milestone of over 10 000 songs liberated. That&#39;s a pretty awesome number! That many times someone wanted to hear a particular song while not at their computer or over an internet connection and we aided them in that! I&#39;ll follow up with some interesting tidbits from the request logs when I get a chance. Thanks &lt;3" />
