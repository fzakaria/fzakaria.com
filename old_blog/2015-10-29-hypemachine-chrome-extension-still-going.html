      <h2> Short and Sweet </h2>
<p>
This will be a short and sweet post. It's been a while since I've used my <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">HypeMachine Chrome Extension</a> and just as long since I've used <a href="https://hypem.com">HypeMachine</a> (my music taste has shifted). However I'm always surprises me the community of people using the extension.</p>
<p>
I've recently merged in some new code that allows the user to download <strong>multiple</strong> songs at once which was graciously written by <a href="https://github.com/skotz">Scott Clayton</a>. The code is now in <em>master</em>, so feel free to re-install the extension and give the new functionality a whirl!</p>
