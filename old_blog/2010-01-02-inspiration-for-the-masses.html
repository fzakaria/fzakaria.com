<meta name="description" content="Getting closer to my work term I also look for inspiration to motivate me and peak my enthusiasm so that I can bring into the workplace. Browsing TED (something I&rsquo;ve missed doing in a while), I immediately came across Steve Job&rsquo;s Stanford Commencement speech. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish I got an eerie chill listening to his story and how pieces to his puzzle of life only seemed to fit after reflecting upon them; for instance like his calligraphy lessons. The point of the talk was aimed at don&rsquo;t accept anything but true love and passion for a job and constantly be on the lookout and search for that passion. I am hoping that in this new job, my search is over. &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt; Seth Godin I really like Seth Godin. He gives riveting talks that are funny while still driving home a message. He is a wealth of stories, of which I could sit for hours probably just listening to. Although everything i&rsquo;ve heard him say ( I plan to read a few of his books) is accurate and logical he seems to be always reinventing his own wheel between each talk, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s still a wheel? Confused by what I said? I know I am. Essentially what I get from each of his talks is that : mass marketing is dead. viral marketing is the future/present marketing now for the extremes rather than the average These are the staples of most talks he give, and he will bundle them up in a brand new metaphor or idea differently between all he talks I&rsquo;ve seen. It&rsquo;s not the problem that he is reiterating the message continuously, but rather that he it seems as if he is attempting through rewording the message to create a new one? Regardless great talks. &lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;" />

<h3> Seth Godin </h3>
<p>I really like Seth Godin. He gives riveting talks that are funny while still driving home a message. He is a wealth of stories, of which I could sit for hours probably just listening to. Although everything i&rsquo;ve heard him say ( I plan to read a few of his books) is accurate and logical he seems to be always reinventing his own wheel between each talk, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s still a wheel? Confused by what I said? I know I am.<br />
Essentially what I get from each of his talks is that :</p>
<ol>
<li>mass marketing is dead.</li>
<li>viral marketing is the future/present</li>
<li>marketing now for the extremes rather than the average</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the staples of most talks he give, and he will bundle them up in a brand new metaphor or idea differently between all he talks I&rsquo;ve seen. It&rsquo;s not the problem that he is reiterating the message continuously, but rather that he it seems as if he is attempting through rewording the message to create a new one?</p>
<p><em>Regardless great talks.</em></p>
