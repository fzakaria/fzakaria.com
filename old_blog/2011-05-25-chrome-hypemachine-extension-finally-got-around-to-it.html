<h3> My Inexperience </h3>
<p>
Took me longer to find the reason for it being broken than I'd like to care to admit. As I've mentioned earlier, I don't have much experience with Javascript,HTTP ,CSS and Web-development in general. Finding the culprit was more from my determination at prodding and learning as I go. Turns out the fix was really simple, and I missed it easily because I have no experience specifically with CSS. Here was the culprit for those that are interested:</p>
<pre>
<code>
function ext_load(ext, vis) {
    if (ext && (/Firefox/.test(navigator.userAgent) || /Chrome/.test(navigator.userAgent))) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            if ($$('.gmlink').length || $$('.cext').length || $$('.tri').length) {
                var head;
                var script;
                head = $$('head')[0];
                if (head) {
                    script = new Element('script', {
                        id: "ext_adview",
                        type: 'text/javascript',
                        src: '/js/ext_adview.js'
                    });
                    head.appendChild(script);
                }
                pageTracker._setVar('ext_check');
            }
        }, 5000);
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Although a number of fixes were possible, I took the laziest. I just renamed my CSS attribute names.</p>
