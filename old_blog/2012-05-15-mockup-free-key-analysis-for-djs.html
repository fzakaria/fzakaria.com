      <h2> Key Analysis </h2>
<p>
I've been lately been learning to DJ&Mixing (very basic techniques), and an important component to smooth transitions is key harmony. Transitioning to songs within a certain key range is easier and sounds better. A quick example (cheat sheet) for knowing which keys are compatible is the Camelot System Wheel (which I can't display because it has a copyright) or<br />
<img align="center" class="size-full wp-image-1095" src="http://www.beatunes.com/images/open_key_notation_250.png" alt="Open Key Notation" /></a></p>
<p>
Currently the only means for a DJ to get the key information for his songs are either costly or tedious. Here are the methods I'm most aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using commercial software<br />
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.djtechtools.com/2009/11/02/key-analysis-software-smackdown/">DJTechTools</a> has a great article on all the different costly software available for attaching key information to  your songs</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Looking up the song on Beatport and embedding the information yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually <em>caught </em>my roommate manually searching every MP3 he owned on Beatport and editing the ID3 tags to get the key information.</p>
<p>
First thing comes to mind as a Software Engineer whenever I see such a repetitive task is, <strong><em>"This should be automated immediately"</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>DJ Helper</h2>
<p>
Originally the idea was to automate the process of browsing Beatport for the song and grabbing the BPM/Key. This proved to be too difficult however because the Beatport API doesn't support searching for a track. Browsing the interwebz for ideas, I then came across <a href="http://the.echonest.com/">Echo Nest</a>.</p>

<strong>TO DO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add the analysis information into the ID3 comments tag of the Mp3 File</li>
<li>Allow bulk processing of songs.</li>
