      <h2> Tricky semantics </h2>
<p>
Getting back into Python for work, I've been writing a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> application. When you write Python, I tend to always want to try and write it in the most '<em>Pythonic</em>' way. To me, the word represents at it's basic form writing Python code in a way that reads itself easily; nearly as English. <em>I'm sure I'm completely wrong and that it only represents awesome crazy list comprehensions...</em></p>
<blockquote><p>A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language.</p></blockquote>

With the prerequisite of a perhaps faulty state of mind, I tend to use the keywords <strong>not </strong> and <strong>is</strong> abundantly in my boolean expressions. The <strong>is</strong> keyword however stumped me when used on Strings. The following two if statements are not identical. In fact, using the <strong>is</strong> keyword will likely fail the boolean expression.</p>
<pre>
<code>
#Test1
if a is "test":
    print "Is Found"
#Test2
if a == "test":
    print "Equality Found"
</code>
</pre>
<p>Why was this tricky however? Once I noticed the condition failing, I did my favourite thing to do when debugging Python, I launched the console!<br />

Didn't take too long Googling to get to the bottom of this however, and as always Stackoverflow provided a nice <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2987958/how-is-the-is-keyword-implemented-in-python">answer</a>.</p>

<p>I put the header as <em>tricky</em>, however I guess at the end of the day it's my fault for not knowing the language better.</p>
