      <h3> Let's try another route </h3>
<p>
No sooner had I posted my <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/2011/05/chrome-hypemachine-extension-finally-got-around-to-it/">fix</a> for my Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imbbbpnnjeljfopnjohfoieconfedbhh">HypeMachine Extension</a>, it had seemed to be broken again. <em>I guess an easy fix deserved was going to get an easy work-around.</em></p>
<p>
Since my "fix" was simply just renaming the CSS element, it was also just as easy for <a href="http://hypem.com/">them</a> to also just change the javascript to match my names. </p>
<blockquote><p>The 'ext_load' function mentioned earlier was also moved to within a larger function. I'm guessing to stop me from simply overloading the function...</p></blockquote>
<p>This time I thought I would try something else and see where it takes me.</p>
<h3> Will this work? </h3>
<p>
I just pushed a change to the Chrome Extension that will hopefully avoid the back & forth of changing CSS element names by randomizing them instead. Here is a little snippet of how I randomized the CSS element names. The reference for the code I used can be found <a href="http://jonraasch.com/blog/javascript-style-node">here</a>.</p>
<pre>
<code>
function randomStringGenerator()
{
    var chars = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    var string_length = 8;
    var randomstring = "";
    for (var i = 0 ; i < string_length ; i++)
    {
        var rnum = Math.floor(Math.random()* chars.length);
        randomstring += chars.charAt(rnum);
    }
    return randomstring;
}

var cssElementToRandom =  randomStringGenerator();
var css = document.createElement('style');
css.type = 'text/css';
var styles = '.'+cssElementToRandom+'{ width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 9px solid transparent; border-right: 9px solid transparent;	border-top: 10px solid #494949; }';

if (css.styleSheet) css.styleSheet.cssText = styles;
else css.appendChild(document.createTextNode(styles));

document.getElementByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(css);
