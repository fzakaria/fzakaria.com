Found a few neat tools online to convert them to RGB and decide to roll my own. It&#39;s pretty straightforward. There are a bunch of different ways to grab the y, u , v data and this one is a bit more intricate as it moves the cursor constantly to get the appropriate UV position for the current Y value.

I would like to rewrite this so that it is more generic for all YUV formats depending on their sample period." />

      <h2> For those curious </h2>
<p>
It's funny that I never questioned why whenever a video playback was corrupted or malfunctioned it displayed a green screen.Even at my current job, having learned about color space conversion and the different ways to represent color it still never clicked. To be fair I think it's because we are taught in school how to think with the RGB color space and not YUV. The answer though is really simple, but just found it interesting <strong>I had never connected the dots</strong>. <em>The conversion of a YUV value of 0 to RGB is the dull green color!</em><br />

<h2> Converting NV12 </h2>
<p>
I work with a lot of YUV (NV12) files. Found a few neat tools online to convert them to RGB and decide to roll my own. It's pretty straightforward. There are a bunch of different ways to grab the y, u , v data and this one is a bit more intricate as it moves the cursor constantly to get the appropriate UV position for the current Y value. To get a better understanding of conversions from YUV to RGB and about colour spaces in general, I found that the MSDN was a great place.
