      <h2> Why don't you work! </h2>
<p>
I'm pretty new to developing on the linux platform and I've been dived head first since starting my new job. My development environment contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>RHEL5 (RedHat 5)</li>
<li>Eclispe (Indigo)</li>
<li>Perforce (p4v) </li>
<li>BeyondCompare 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything works beautifully together (with accompanying plugins) except for one thing; <em>File Diffs</em>.</p>
<p>
Although I can setup through my Perforce Eclipse plugin which external tool to use for merges, Eclipse doesn't let me change the default file comparison tool (it uses the default one provided by Eclipse).</p>
<p>
I'd like to be able to set this to BeyondCompare! There are some plugins that let you diff two files using any external comparison tool however they don't integrate with P4!</p>
<blockquote><p>Gaaaaah!</p></blockquote>
