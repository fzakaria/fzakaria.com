Making retrieving song requiring two Ajax requests. For those that are curious to look at the HypeMachine&#39;s javascript, you will notice that it has been minified in order to save space. I&#39;ve been suing JSBeautifier , in order to &#39;un-minify&#39; it. A very clean and wonderfully helpful website, kudos. What does this mean for my extension and scripts ? Previously the buttons I injected were linked to straight MP3 but now instead when I inject the buttons I&#39;ll have to perform an Ajax request for each one to get the proper URL to the MP3 file. I haven&#39;t implemented this yet but hopefully it doesn&#39;t cause the injection to be exceedingly slow and unusable. I&#39;ll work on it sometime this week and hopefully can fix it ! The change is less severe for the scripts &amp; java program as I just need to make another request to get the URL before downloading the file. Just another hoop to jump through... I&#39;m Against The Layout Change Hype Machine just pushed a layout change to their website. I just wanted to openly voice my opinion that I am against the change for the following reasons: It is overall visually unappealing. I miss the standard green colour backdrop, I&#39;ve known to come and love. There is a huge grotesque nestea add on the site now.

      <h2> Two For One Ajax Request</h2>
<p>
I believe in an attempt to stop browser extensions that inject download buttons onto <a href="http://hypem.com">HypeMachine's </a>website, they've recently changed how the songs are delivered. This is annoying once again because it means not only my extension is broken but all my scripts + <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/2011/05/java-hypemachine-batch-downloader/">Java Batch Loader</a> as well.<br />
Let's take a look at what they've changed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prior the requests to the song were simply one Ajax Request</p></blockquote>
<h3> Before </h3>
<p><pre>
<code>
 var song_url = "/serve/play/" + activeItem.id + "/" + activeItem.key;
 try {
  currentPlayerObj[0] = soundManager.createSound({
  id: 'currentPlayer' + currentTrack,
  url: song_url 
 }
</code>
</pre></p>
<h3> Now </h3>
<p><pre>
<code>
function playTrack(skip_prompts) {
//removed bunch of code not related to grabbing the song content
r = new Ajax.Request("/serve/source/" + activeItem.id + "/" + activeItem.key, {
 method: 'get',
 onSuccess: function (transport) {
 var source_data;
 source_data = transport.responseText.evalJSON();
 try {
  currentPlayerObj[0] = soundManager.createSound({
  id: 'currentPlayer' + currentTrack,
  url: source_data.url,
  }
  //removed a bunch of settings set for creating the sound object for sake of brevity
 });
}
</code>
</pre></p>
<blockquote><p>The request to <em>"/serve/source/" + activeItem.id + "/" + activeItem.key</em> now results in a JSON object that contains the appropriate URL and some additional data. Making retrieving song requiring <strong>two</strong> Ajax requests.</p></blockquote>
<p>
For those that are curious to look at the HypeMachine's javascript, you will notice that it has been minified in order to save space. I've been suing <a href="http://jsbeautifier.org">JSBeautifier </a>, in order to 'un-minify' it. A very clean and wonderfully helpful website, <strong>kudos</strong>.</p>
<h2> What does this mean for my extension and scripts ? </h2>
<p>

<p>
The change is less severe for the scripts & java program as I just need to make another request to get the URL before downloading the file. </p>

<h2> I'm Against The Layout Change </h2>
<p>
Hype Machine just pushed a layout change to their website. I just wanted to openly voice my opinion that I am against the change for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is overall visually unappealing.</li>
<li>I miss the standard green colour backdrop, I've known to come and love.</li>
<li>There is a huge <strong>grotesque </strong>nestea add on the site now.</li>
<li>I find the fact that only the song content scroll and not the whole site in general hurtful on my eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a pic of the new layout (in case they decide to revert it):<br />
