      <h2> The Spark </h2>
<p>
I've been doing a lot of work (developing multimedia device driver) for Windows 8 for my current job. As such, I had to watch and listen to a bunch of talks about Windows 8 new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqSNuLsLJR4">Metro style applications</a> and thought it would be a pretty neat area to play around in.</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
What's really cool is that to build a Metro Application, you make use of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464942.aspx">WindowsRT </a>(windows Runtime) API. The best part is that the API is available in <strong>multiple </strong>languages including JavaScript, C++, C# and VB</p>
<p>
Since I always seem to use HypeMachine as my guinea pig for learning new technologies, <em>I figured why stop now...</em></p>

<h2> Private API </h2>
<p>
I have known for a while that HypeMachine was providing certain people access to their private API. However I just noticed recently that they've been advertising it.<br />
<a href="http://fzakaria-blog.elasticbeanstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/hypem_dev_access.png"><img src="http://fzakaria-blog.elasticbeanstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/hypem_dev_access.png" alt="" title="HypeMachine Developer API Access" width="277" height="116" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956" style="border:1px solid black"  /></a></p>
<p>I decided to ask for access thinking that in my opinion, my previous relationship with them had been <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/2011/07/removed-hypemachine-chrome-extension/">generous and polite</a>, explaining in my e-mail that I planned on using the API <strong>solely</strong> for my personal Windows 8 project. </p>
<p>
<em>With high spirits, I waited for the response...</em></p>
<h2> Rejection </h2>
<p>
Ultimately I received an e-mail back from HypeMachine explaining that they are <strong>rejecting</strong> my request to be included in the private API because I have been "difficult to work with in the past" and that "we do not have the resources for it". At the end of the day, it is their sole discretion and right to grant access to whoever they'd like to their private API, however I was hoping that  due to my previous relationship (I removed both the Batch-Downloader and Chrome Extension when asked) that I wouldn't be seen as being difficult to work with.</p>
<p>I guess back to <em>hacking </em>it....</p>
