      <h2>Finally have some time</h2>
<p>
I've received numerous (very nice hearing how many people have been using my software) e-mails and responses regarding how my <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScrip">hypescript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Java">batch downloader</a> are no longer working.</p>
<p>
I've recently accepted a new position at Amazon in Seattle and the move was very time consuming. I was saddened at the state of the code and how I felt like I was letting people down by not fixing it in a timely fashion. Now that it's been a month or so since my move I've finally had time to work on fixing them for you guys! :)</p>
<h2>The fix</h2>
<p>
The HypeMachine guys keep breaking the script due to my terrible regular expression I was using to scrape the site for the id & keys. I'm hoping the current regex I've updated it to is more robust and will thwart a few more attempts from them from breaking it!</p>
<h3>What needs to be parsed</h3>
<pre>
<code>
trackList[document.location.href]['item_1n361'] = { 

    seq: trackList[document.location.href].length,
    type:'normal',

};

trackList[document.location.href].push(trackList[document.location.href]['item_1n361']);
</code>
</pre>
<h3>My regular expression</h3>
<pre>
<code>
#old regex
idMatches = re.findall("[ t]id:'(w*)(?=')", contents)
keyMatches = re.findall("(?<=tkey: ')w*(?=')", contents)
songMatches= re.findall("(?<=tsong:').*(?=')", contents)
artistMatches= re.findall("(?<=tartist:').*(?=')", contents)
#new regex
idMatches = re.findall("s+id:s*'(.+)'", contents)
keyMatches = re.findall("s+key:s*'(.+)'", contents)
songMatches = re.findall("s+song:s*'(.+)'", contents)
artistMatches = re.findall("s+artist:s*'(.+)'", contents)
</code>
</pre>
<blockquote><p>If you are more of a wiz at regex than me please recommend a better pattern :)</p></blockquote>
