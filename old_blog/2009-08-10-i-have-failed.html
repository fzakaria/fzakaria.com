I decided to implement LinkedLists in such a way so that the head never needs to be reassigned once declared. This is obviously a stupid way of doing it; with the logical solution to always just return the pointer to the new head. Anyways, at least I can say that I ended up learning the right semantics." />

<h3>Passing pointers by reference</h3>
<p>For some delusional reason, I was under the impression that the only difference of passing a pointer and passing a value by reference is that the compiler would hide all the *&rsquo;s and -> for code readibility.<br />
Turns out (like always) apparently there is more at work than I understood.</p>
<p>Passing a pointer is pretty much passing a value and a local copy is made onto the method&rsquo;s call stack. Where I err&rsquo;d is in attempting to re-assign pointer values within the method. </p>
<p>What I should have done was clearly too either pass in a pointer to the pointer or in my case I chose to do:</p>
<pre>
<code>
Node*  Node::FindNode(Node*& head, int index)
{
	Node* tempP= head;
	for (int i = 0 ; (i <= index) && (head->nextP != NULL); i++)
	{
		if (i == index) 
		{
			return tempP;
		}
		tempP = tempP->nextP;
	}
	return 0;
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now to be fair. I decided to implement LinkedLists in such a way so that the head never needs to be reassigned once declared. This is obviously a stupid way of doing it; with the logical solution to always just return the pointer to the new head.</p>
