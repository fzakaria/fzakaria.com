      <h2> tl;dr; </h2>
<p> Let's get straight to the point; I believe I have finally fixed the download name issue. You can download the latest fix in the chrome-bug-373182 branch; simply download the zip <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension/archive/chrome-bug-373182.zip">chrome-bug-373182.zip</a></p>
<h2> Explanation </h2>
<p> For those curious who have been tracking the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=373182">Chrome bug</a>; I thought the issue was unsolvable as the latest fix has caused any cross-origin requests to not respect the download attribute (except for data URIs). I had nevertheless believed I had fixed it earlier because when testing some downloads (from the <a href="http://hypem.com/popular">popular</a> page) I only attempted the first page of songs loaded. The <strong>glaring problem</strong> however was that the songs loaded upon scrolling down were not receiving the jQuery <strong>on</strong> event (even with the delegation syntax!). My solution at the moment, is simply to unbind all event handlers for the array key and re-bind them upon any ajax completion. This isn't the greatest solution but it works!<br />
