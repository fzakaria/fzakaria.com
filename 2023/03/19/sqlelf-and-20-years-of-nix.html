<p>🎉 We are celebrating 20 years of <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a> 🎉</p>

<p>Within that 20 years Nix has ushered in a new paradigm of how to build software reliably that is becoming more ubiquitous in the software industry.
It has inspired imitators such as <a href="https://spack.io/">Spack</a> &amp; <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>.</p>

<p>Given the concepts introduced by Nix and it’s willingnes to eschew some fundamental Linux concepts such as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.</p>

<p>I can’t help but think <em>has Nix gone far enough within the 20 years?</em></p>

<!--more-->

<p>If you have kept an eye on some of the work I’ve been doing and thinking of, I have spent some time thinking how Nix can make further progress on goals of reliability and reproducibility.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you haven’t seen my talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZKFe4mCkr4">Rethinking basic primitives for store based systems</a>, I recommend you watch it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nix, and more specifically NixOS, is uniquely poised to do-away with many of the historic cruft that has plaque us in software due to the fact that it’s dependency closure goes down to the Linux kernel!</p>

<p>There is no short-list of components we can re-imagine however I have been focused on the dynamic linker / interpreter. Concepts of the *Unixes of the world which are largely historic are up for grabs.</p>

<p>As part of my work on <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/shrinkwrap">Shrinkwrap</a>, I was getting pretty frustrated working with the ELF file format.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Checkout my SuperComputing 2022 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05118">Mapping Out the HPC Dependency Chaos</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best tools we have to introspect binaries are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readelf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">objdump</code> whom simply dump raw ASCII text to the console.</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">❯ readelf --demangle --dyn-syms /usr/bin/ruby | head

Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 22 entries:
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND 
     1: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND ruby_run_node
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Why are we restricted to such a challenging file format to work with?</em></p>

<p>I am working on an idea which I am very excited about 🤓 which I will be writing about.
To prove to myself that the idea has merit, I wanted to explore making a tool that allows for easier introspection of ELF files.</p>

<p>Using the power of <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> and the Virtual Tables concept, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/sqlelf">sqlelf</a>: <em>Explore ELF objects through the power of SQL.</em></p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">❯ sqlelf /usr/bin/ruby /bin/ls /usr/bin/pnmarith
</span><span class="gp">sqlite&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>SELECT elf_headers.path, COUNT<span class="o">(</span><span class="k">*</span><span class="o">)</span> as num_sections
<span class="gp">    ..&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>FROM elf_headers
<span class="gp">    ..&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>INNER JOIN elf_sections ON elf_headers.path <span class="o">=</span> elf_sections.path
<span class="gp">    ..&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>WHERE elf_headers.type <span class="o">=</span> 3
<span class="gp">    ..&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>GROUP BY elf_headers.path<span class="p">;</span>
<span class="go">path|num_sections
/bin/ls|31
/usr/bin/pnmarith|27
/usr/bin/ruby|28
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I can prove a clean 1:1 mapping between the two formats then there is an amazing room for potential.</p>

<p>I am still working through the domain model mapping to individual tables (<em>contributions and help appreciated!</em>) but I am really excited by this idea.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Linker specifications can be articulated with SQL to guarantee semantics.</li>
  <li>Dynamic loader specifications can also be defined with SQL + potentially use of ACID constraints.</li>
  <li>Analysis of files can be done at large easily using SQL.</li>
  <li>We remove a custom file format.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unix introduced the simple concept of <em>what if everything was a file?</em></p>

<p>🙈 🙉 🙊 <strong>What if everything was a database?</strong> 🙈 🙉 🙊</p>
