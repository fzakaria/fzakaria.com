      <p>Nix is an amazing tool, unfortunately doing <em>simple</em> things can be quite challenging.</p>

<p>This is a little write-up of my attempt to try and accomplish what I would have thought to be a <em>simple</em> thing; computing all store paths for every attribute in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/">nixpkgs</a>.</p>

<p>Why would I want to do such a thing?</p>

<p>I had some <em>/nix/store</em> entries on my system and I wanted to revisit the <strong>exact</strong> nixpkgs commit with which it was built to debug something.
Without this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_index">reverse index</a> you are pretty much out of luck for figuring it out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to give early <em>shoutout</em> to other similar tools in this space that let you do meta searches over nixpkgs such as <a href="https://lazamar.co.uk/nix-versions/">Nix Package Versions</a> and <a href="https://pkgs.on-nix.com/">Pkgs on Nix</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>üó£Ô∏è This goal has been made extra arduous due to the migrations of the new Nix CLI commands and the migration to Flakes.</p>

<h2 id="-goal-1-get-a-list-of-all-package-names">üéØ Goal 1: Get a list of all package names</h2>

<p>Any attempt to try and do this within the Nix language expression is <strong>doomed</strong>.
Any immediate attempt to iterate over all keys within the <em>top-level</em> attribute in Nixpkgs is faced with hurdle and after hurdle.</p>

<p>I got pretty far with the following <a href="https://gist.github.com/fzakaria/ae27a2ad58e1d80f5453b0ed0052297f">gist</a> but it still hit roadblocks.</p>

<p>Feedback from the community has been to use <em>nix</em> tooling such as <em>nix-env</em> or <em>nix-search</em> that have special handling for all these sharp edges, or some of the <em>fancier</em> work used
by <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/hydra">hydra</a> or <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/ofborg/">ofborg</a>.</p>

<p>I succumb to peer pressure and decided to use these tools üòÆ‚Äçüí® rather than what I was hoping to be an elegant <em>pure Nix</em> expression.</p>

  <p>üòë Super annoying that these new Nix commands even with <em>-L</em> continue to write the text in-place for their log output.</p>

<h2 id="-goal-2-compute-outpaths-for-every-package">üéØ Goal 2: Compute outPaths for every package</h2>

<p>Since we are using <em>nix search</em> the names of the packages are now following the Flakes naming convention with prefixing them with <em>legacyPackages</em>.</p>

<p>The plan here to continue with the new Nix commands and now evaluate the <em>outPath</em> of each package.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è This does not build the derivation.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è I could not seem to make this <em>parallel</em> at all since the evaluation requires a global lock.</p>

<p>Now I just need to rename <em>outpaths.txt</em> to something that indicates the Git commit I used when generating this and I am starting to
build some nice structure data üìä.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-work-and-collaboration">Bonus Work and Collaboration</h2>

<p>Of course what I am doing here is only generating for my current <em>builtins.currentSystem</em> (i.e. x86_64) and will not generate for all other supported platforms.</p>

<p>There are also recursive subtrees within <em>nixpkgs</em> such as <em>pkgsStatic</em> or <em>pkgsMusl</em> that I don‚Äôt believe are returned from <em>nix search</em> and therefore I am not
detecting those output paths.</p>

<p>I would like to continue to understand better how tools such as Hydra generate all attributes for all systems.</p>

<p>If this problem and goal to build an <em>outputPath</em> reverse index for Nix sounds interesting, reach out to <a href="mailto:farid.m.zakaria@gmail.com">me</a>!
I would love to collaborate.</p>
